Subject: [PATCH] FortranCInterface: Fix compatibility with GCC gfortran 12 LTO
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since version 12.0 the GCC Fortran compiler has implemented "WG5/N1942",
which causes, if link-time opmization is enabled, obfuscation of hard-coded
string values in the compiler objects and its resulting ELF-binaries.

This causes the CMake-internal detection of the mangling scheme for the
naming of subroutines to fail.  Thus we must ensure to have any link-time
optimization features to be disabled on the executable file we perform the
detection on.

Fixes: #23123
